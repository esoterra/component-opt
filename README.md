# Component Optimizer

This project is currently a thin wrapper around `wasmparser`, `wasm-opt`, and `wasm-encoder`
so that it's easy to apply a basic set of optimizations to wasm components.

It has very limited functionality, is not very configurable, and has not been extensively tested.

Use at your own risk and consider contributing if you want it improved.
